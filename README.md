# BioMemTest
Just a computer Bio-experiment...

## A small biography of the project
*This is just for me so that I can categorize the project in 10 years time.*

This was once my biology experiment. I was investigating how loud music affects the ability to memorize a number. I was more or less new to java programming and so I decided that it would be cool to make a small java app that generates a number, displayed it for a few seconds and then request the user to type it in the response box. The idea was the user gets a score for each correct response. The experiment was done several levels of *Gangnam Style* in the background. The noise levels were later plotted against the score. These are the results:

**So yeah, I guess You should stay in a quiet place when preparing for a math test** :smile:
